# Generating Your Spotify Token
This document will walk you through how to generate a Spotify token by accessing your `CLIENT ID` and `CLIENT SECRET`. To learn more about what a "token" is and why Spotify requires it, visit the [What is a Spotify Token](#What-is-a-Spotify-Token) section at the bottom of this page.

### 01. Spotify Developer Dashboard
