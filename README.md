# Spotipy Analysis
Welcome to `spotipy_analysis`, an application that allows you to generate an analysis of any collection of Spotify playlists on-command! 

## Getting Started
Before jumping into learning more about your music tastes, you must follow these steps:
- Ensure you're connected to the internet
- Create a [Spotify Developer account](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login) using your Spotify login information
- Select `CREATE AN APP` - `name` and `description` do no matter; when finished, press `CREATE`
- Locate your unique `Client ID` and `Client Secret`; these two values will be used to access Spotify's API
Aside from collecting the playlist(s) you'd like to generate an analysis for, you're good to go! Continue reading to the `User Interaction Guide` if you'd like to learn more about how to interact with the application.

## User Interaction Guide
User Interaction is limited to expandable boxes scattered throughout the application. Look for boxes with a plus at the right end as you navigate the dashboard to enter various input.
