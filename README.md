# Spotipy Analysis
Welcome to `spotipy_analysis`, an application that allows you to generate an analysis of any collection of Spotify playlists on-command! Ever wanted to learn more about why you like the music you listen to? Or how on Earth someone else likes the music they listen to? Using this dashbaord, you can analyze the unique and overlapping features of any array of songs, artists, or albums from any year, country, or planet (may or may not be limited to this planet).

Below you'll find a `Getting Started` tab and `User Interaction` guide. Both sections will lead you through how to prepare the necessary input data to utilize the app and how to analyze said data after your playlists have been collected, respectively.

## Getting Started
Before jumping into learning more about your music tastes, you must follow these steps:

- Ensure you're connected to the internet
- Create a [Spotify Developer account](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login) using your Spotify login information
- Select `CREATE AN APP` - `name` and `description` do no matter; when finished, press `CREATE`
- Locate your unique `Client ID` and `Client Secret`; these two values will be used to access Spotify's API

Aside from collecting the playlist(s) you'd like to generate an analysis for, you're good to go! Continue reading to the `User Interaction Guide` if you'd like to learn more about how to interact with the application.

## User Interaction Guide
User Interaction is limited to expandable boxes scattered throughout the application. Look for boxes with a plus at the right end as you navigate the dashboard to enter various input.
