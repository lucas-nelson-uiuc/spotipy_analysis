# Spotipy Analysis
Welcome to `spotipy_analysis`, an application that allows you to generate an analysis of any collection of Spotify playlists on-command! Ever wanted to learn more about why you like the music you listen to? Or how on Earth someone else likes the music they listen to? Using this dashbaord, you can analyze the unique and overlapping features of any array of songs, artists, or albums from any year, country, or planet (may or may not be limited to this planet).

Below you'll find a [`Getting Started`](#Getting-Started) tab and [`User Interaction`](#User-Interaction-Guide) guide. Both sections will lead you through how to prepare the necessary input data to utilize the app and how to analyze said data after your playlists have been collected, respectively.

## Getting Started
Before jumping into learning more about your music tastes, you must follow these steps:

- Create a [Spotify Developer account](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login) using your Spotify login information
- Select `CREATE AN APP` (enter any `name` and `description`)
- Press `CREATE`
- Locate `Client ID` and `Client Secret
- Copy to `Client ID` and `Client Secret` into application

Aside from collecting the playlist(s) you'd like to generate an analysis for, you're good to go! Continue reading to the `User Interaction Guide` if you'd like to learn more about how to interact with the application.

## User Interaction Guide
User Interaction is limited to expandable boxes scattered throughout the application. Look for boxes with a plus at the right end as you navigate the dashboard to enter various input.

### Enter Spotify Details
`Client ID`: unique identifier of your application<br>
`Client Secret`: key to pass in secure calls to the Spotify Accounts and Web API services<br>
`Playlist URL(s)`: link(s) to public Spotify playlists; if multiple, separate links by commas

### Resources
Although you just read them, if you ever need help while using the application, there are links that you can use to redirect yourself here.<br>

## Why must you document your project? <a name = "why_document"></a>

- It doesnâ€™t matter how good your software is, because if the documentation is not good enough, people will not use it.
Even if for some reason they have to use it, without good documentation, they wonâ€™t use it effectively or the way youâ€™d like them to
- THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE GLANCE AND LEAVE. Make it pretty so that it's easier for them to star before they leave. The more stars you have, the likelier it is that serious developers will use your repo
- You will be using your code in 6 months. Code that you wrote 6 months ago is often indistinguishable from code that someone else has written
- You want people to use your code because you think that others might find it useful. However, people need to understand why your code might be useful for them, before they decide to use it
- You want people to help out. If you donâ€™t have documentation, you will miss out on a whole class of contributors
- You want to be a better writer


## Best Practices<a name = "best_practices"></a>

**Things to remember:**

- Keep a lighthearted friendly tone. Treat the reader as someone who doesn't have a lot of knowledge about the topic but is very interested
- Keep things brief
- Use headings frequently. This breaks things up when reading and often it is good for linking to specific information
- Link to other places in the documentation often but only for additional information. Readers should not have to navigate through several pages to find information regarding one specific thing. Just inline the immediately relevant information and link off if they want to know more
- Use as many code snippets, CLI, etc. examples as possible. Show the reader what you mean
- Gently introduce a guide before diving into technical details. This gives context and readers are more likely to stay engaged longer
- It is always good to describe the functionality of the various files in your project
- Always use gender-neutral pronouns. A gender-neutral pronoun is a pronoun which does not associate a gender with the individual who is being discussed. For eg. - using 'they' instead of 'he/she'

**Things you should avoid:**

- Don't assume prior knowledge about the topic. If you want to appeal to a large audience, then you are going to have people with very diverse backgrounds
- Don't use idioms. Write using more formal terms that are well defined. This makes it easier for non-native English speakers and for translations to be written
- Don't clutter explanations with overly detailed examples
- Don't use terms that are offensive to any group. There will never be a good reason to
