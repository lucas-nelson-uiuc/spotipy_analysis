## Create Your Own Recommendations

### Parameters
Here you can tweak specific attributes to find music that falls within the range of the specified minimum and maximum values per parameter.

If you do not adjust the values, recommendations will be generated within a +/- 10 range of your average value for the specific parameter.

### User Input
Here you can enter a specific track (URL), artist (URL), or genre (based on Spotify's list of recognized genres) to specify your recommendation futher.

These parameters do not need to be from any of the playlists you have entered in the sidebar and will generate a list of recommended songs based on your desired maximum number of results.
