Similar filtering capabilities to previous graph.

### Artist Album Workshop

At its core, music is a form of art. However, one medium of the art that often goes overlooked is the album cover that artists use as a symbol of their music.

This neat feature allows you to not only explore the art that artists attach to their music but also alter various features to derive a piece of art that the artist may have considered otherwise.

At the end of the day, it's just a little fun to have while learning more about your taste of music.
